# 🛡️ Application Layer Security Lab — Web Traffic & Protocol Protection

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and securing **application layer traffic** across common web protocols.  
The objective was to inspect HTTP/HTTPS behavior, understand how applications expose data, and identify weak configurations or security gaps at Layer 7.

This lab showcases my ability to:
- Capture and analyze HTTP/HTTPS traffic in detail  
- Inspect request/response headers, cookies, caching, and session data  
- Identify insecure or abnormal application behavior  
- Examine differences between plaintext and encrypted traffic  
- Validate application-layer protections such as redirects and basic filtering  
- Document Layer 7 findings in a clear and concise format
