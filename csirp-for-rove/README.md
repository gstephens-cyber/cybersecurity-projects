# 🛡️ Incident Response Plan — ROVE Cybersecurity Case

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates the creation of a full **Cybersecurity Incident Response Plan (CSIRP)** for the organization ROVE.  
The objective of this work was to design a complete, actionable response framework aligned with industry standards and suited for a real operational environment.

This plan showcases my ability to:
- Develop structured incident response procedures  
- Define roles, responsibilities, and communication channels  
- Align response phases to NIST and enterprise best practices  
- Document response workflows clearly and professionally

## 🗂️ Plan Summary
The CSIRP includes:
- Defined incident categories & severity levels  
- Response team structure  
- Step-by-step actions for identification, containment, eradication, and recovery  
- Communication and escalation flows  
- Executive, internal, and external reporting guidelines  
- Post-incident analysis procedure  

Key features:
- Enterprise-ready structure  
- Clear lifecycle coverage  
- Practical, real-world applicability
