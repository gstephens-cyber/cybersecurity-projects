# 🛡️ Risk Assessment Report — Financial Web Server Analysis

## 📌 Overview
This project presents a complete **Risk Assessment Report** for a mission-critical financial web server.  
The objective of this work was to identify key threats, evaluate their impact, and recommend security controls to strengthen organizational security posture.

This report demonstrates my ability to:
- Analyze enterprise assets and security exposures  
- Build structured attack trees for multiple threat types  
- Perform impact and severity assessments  
- Recommend actionable, prioritized controls  
- Communicate technical findings clearly and professionally
