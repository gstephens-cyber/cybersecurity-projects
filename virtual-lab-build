# 🧩 Virtual Lab Build — Cisco Modeling Labs (CML)

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates the deployment of a full virtualized lab environment using **Cisco Modeling Labs (CML)**.  
The objective was to design a functional, multi-device network topology that supports switching, routing, VLAN segmentation, and host connectivity—mirroring a mini-enterprise network.

This lab showcases my ability to:
- Architect network topologies  
- Deploy virtual routers, switches, and endpoints  
- Configure interface addressing  
- Validate connectivity and troubleshoot issues
