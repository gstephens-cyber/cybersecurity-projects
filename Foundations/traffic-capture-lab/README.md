# 🔬 Traffic Capture Lab — Packet Analysis & Network Visibility

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on capturing and analyzing network traffic using **Wireshark** to understand protocol behavior, identify anomalies, and validate security controls.  
The objective was to inspect packets at a granular level and gain visibility into how hosts communicate across a network.

This lab showcases my ability to:
- Capture live network traffic on selected interfaces
- Analyze packet structures and protocol flows
- Inspect ARP, ICMP, TCP, UDP, HTTP, and DNS behavior
- Identify abnormal or suspicious traffic patterns
- Correlate packet traces with host activity
- Document findings in a clear, security-focused report

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- **Wireshark**
- **tcpdump** (CLI capture)
- **Virtualized lab network**
- **Common network protocols (ARP, ICMP, TCP, UDP, HTTP, DNS)**

---

## 🧪 Skills Demonstrated
- Packet capture configuration (filters, interfaces, capture options)
- Use of **display filters** to isolate interesting traffic
- Protocol decoding and header interpretation
- Timing and flow analysis (three-way handshake, DNS queries, etc.)
- Identification of misconfigurations or risky behavior from packet data
- Professional reporting of technical findings for a cybersecurity audience

## 🔍 Lab Artifacts
- **Traffic Capture Lab report (PDF)** — full walkthrough of the capture, analysis steps, screenshots, and conclusions.

This repository folder contains the completed lab report so reviewers can see both the **technical work** and the **written analysis**.
