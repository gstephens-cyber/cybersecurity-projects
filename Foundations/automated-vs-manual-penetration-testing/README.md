# 🛠️ Automated vs Manual Penetration Testing

## 📌 Overview
This project presents a comparative analysis between **automated** and **manual** penetration testing methodologies.  
The objective was to evaluate the strengths, weaknesses, cost implications, and ideal use-cases of each method, ultimately demonstrating why a **hybrid penetration testing strategy** provides the strongest security posture.

This assignment showcases my ability to:

- Evaluate penetration testing methodologies  
- Compare accuracy, scalability, and depth of analysis  
- Assess strengths and limitations of automated tools  
- Analyze human-driven manual testing approaches  
- Recommend an optimal hybrid testing model  
- Communicate cybersecurity findings in a structured, professional format
