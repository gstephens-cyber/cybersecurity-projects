# 🛡️ Automated vs Manual Penetration Testing — Comparative Analysis

## 📌 Overview
This project provides a full **comparative analysis** of automated and manual penetration testing methodologies.  
The objective was to evaluate strengths, limitations, accuracy, scalability, cost, and practical use cases for each testing approach.

This report showcases my ability to:
- Analyze cybersecurity methodologies at a professional level  
- Compare two major penetration testing strategies  
- Evaluate industry tools and testing frameworks  
- Produce structured, research-supported documentation
